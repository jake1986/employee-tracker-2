# employee-tracker-2
This is an app for managing a company's employees using Node, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company So that I can organize and plan my business

**Installation:**

- node tracker.js

**Built with:**

- MySQL NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

- Inquirer NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

- Console.table to print MySQL rows to the console. I installed the console.table with npm i console.table, but preferred not to use the package.

**Functionality:**

- The command-line application should allow users to: Add departments, roles, employees

- View departments, roles, employees

- Update employee roles

- Delete departments, roles, and employees

**ADDITIONS TO BE MADE:**

- There are additional features to be added such as creating quieries for users to delete departments, managers, and roles, etc.
